**DESCRIPTION**:

IN THIS TASK I HAVE PERFORMED AN API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION PROGRAM BY USING VISUAL STUDIO CODE WHICH CAN USED IN REAL FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE WHERE

*Students can use this code as a starting point for learning about API integration, data manipulation with Pandas, and data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

*Teachers can use this code to demonstrate real-time weather data and its visualization.

*This project is suitable for introductory Python programming workshops focused on API interaction and data handling.

*Connect weather data to smart home systems to automate tasks, such as adjusting thermostats or watering lawns.

*Companies can use weather data to optimize routes, schedule deliveries, and mitigate risks.

Real-time Data: Provides access to up-to-date weather information.
Customization: Allows for flexible data manipulation and visualization.
Automation: Can be integrated into automated workflows and systems.

**By customizing and expanding upon this basic code, you can create a wide range of applications that leverage the power of real-time weather data

The tools used in the Python code for fetching weather data and creating visualizations are:

Python Programming Language: This is the core language used to write the script.

Requests Library: Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):The OpenWeatherMap API returns data in JSON format, which is then parsed by Python.
Â  
Pandas Library: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames, which are essential for organizing and working with the weather data.

Matplotlib Library:Used for creating basic data visualizations, such as bar plots.

Seaborn Library:Used for creating more advanced and visually appealing statistical graphics. It builds on top of Matplotlib.

OpenWeatherMap API:The external API that provides the weather data.
